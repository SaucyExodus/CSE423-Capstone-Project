SLACKS API

The following is a list of APIs within SLACK we plan on implementing into our task manager

WEB Api - a majority of Slack’s functionality revolves around their HTTP methods and we will be using these API calls for task tracking/monitoring, task creation and assignment, and customization settings.

EVENTS Api - this will allow us to create external tasks that can be pushed directly into the app which will help us in task creation.

EXTERNAL APIs

These are external APIs that we plan on integrating into our plugin.

ARGO CD - this api is easily compatible with Slack and will help us in sending real time notifications at different stages of a task creation to help users track progress.

Google Calendar API - google’s api allows for customization to fit the branding of our plugin and it can be easily integrated with Slack’s web api so teams and businesses can plan stay organized.
